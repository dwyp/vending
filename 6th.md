Exact Change Only
-----------------

_As a customer_  
_I want to be told when exact change is required_  
_So that I can determine if I can buy something with the money I have before inserting it_

When the machine is not able to make change with the money in the machine for any of the items that it sells, it will
display EXACT CHANGE ONLY instead of INSERT COIN.
