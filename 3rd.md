Make Change
-----------

_As a vendor_  
_I want customers to receive correct change_  
_So that they will use the vending machine again_

When a product is selected that costs less than the amount of money in the machine, then the remaining amount is placed
in the coin return.

You will at least want a method that figures out how much money should be returned and sends it to a method that displays the amount returned.
