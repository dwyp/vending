Select Product
--------------

_As a vendor_  
_I want customers to select products_  
_So that I can give them an incentive to put money in the machine_

There are three products: cola for $1.00, chips for $0.50, and candy for $0.65.  When the respective button is pressed
and enough money has been inserted, the product is dispensed and the machine displays THANK YOU.  If the display is
checked again, it will display INSERT COIN and the current amount will be set to $0.00.  If there is not enough money
inserted then the machine displays PRICE and the price of the item and subsequent checks of the display will display
either INSERT COIN or the current amount as appropriate.

You will at least want a method to accept a button press. You can stub out a method that dispenses the product.
